**NOTE:** 
> AppEngage needs `Google Play services` and `Android Support Library v4`. 

> `Android Support Library v13` can be also be used instead of v4 if your project already requires it.

#### Follow these steps to integrate AppEngage into your existing/new Android Studio Project
1. Click on `File` -> `New` -> `New Module`
2. Choose `“import .JAR/.AAR Package”` and click `“Next”`
3. Now locate the `AppEngage sdk .aar/.jar file` in the downloaded library in the `“File name”` field. Once located, the `“Subproject name”` should auto-populate. If not, just give it any name like “appengage” and click `“Finish”`. This is now imported as a module in your workspace. We will be referencing this in next step.
